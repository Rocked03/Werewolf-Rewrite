# Discord Werewolf
Discord Werewolf is a bot that runs the game Werewolf (Mafia) on Discord. It is written in Python using discord.py. You can find me on Discord as belungawhale#4813.

## Setting the bot up
This bot requires at least Python 3.6 to run.
Clone this repository. Install dependencies by following the instructions under Dependencies. Rename `config.py.example` to `config.py` and `settings.py.example` to `settings.py`, and fill in the fields inside config.py. To change some gameplay-related settings, edit settings.py.

## Dependencies
Discord Werewolf has hard dependencies on discord.py and aiohttp. You can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.

## Running the bot
You must first create a new bot account at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me. Put the bot's token inside config.py. Next, add the bot to your server using the OAuth2 link `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=8` for faster setup or `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=268536848` for finer tuning of permissions, replacing CLIENT_ID with the client id. If you are running on Windows, run `python bot.py` or double-click run.bat to launch the auto-restarter (it will restart the bot if it crashes for whatever reason). If you are running on a UNIX-based system, run either `python3 bot.py` or `python3.6 bot.py`.
